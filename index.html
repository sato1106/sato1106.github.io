            <div class="content">
              The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated
              junglefowl species, with attributes of wild species such as the
              grey and the Ceylon junglefowl[1] that are originally from
              Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male
              bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has
              been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen
              and a sexually immature female is called a pullet. Originally
              raised for cockfighting during the 500 B.C time frame in China
              according to estimations in the study of the sub-haplogroup C1,[2]
              or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until
              the Hellenistic period (4th–2nd centuries BC).[3][4] Humans now
              keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their
              meat and eggs) and as pets. Chickens are one of the most common
              and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7
              billion as of 2018,[5] up from more than 19 billion in 2011.[6]
              There are more chickens in the world than any other bird.[6] There
              are numerous cultural references to chickens – in myth, folklore
              and religion, and in language and literature. Genetic studies have
              pointed to multiple maternal origin theories of within South Asia,
              Southeast Asia, and East Asia,[7] but the clade found in the
              Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from the
              Indian subcontinent. From ancient India, the chicken spread to
              Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to Greece by the 5th century
              BC.[8] Fowl have been known in Egypt since the mid-15th century
              BC, with the "bird that gives birth every day" having come from
              the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the
              annals of Thutmose III.[9][10][11] In 2011 a study in genetic and
              archaeological[12] evidence conclude that the origin of the
              modern-day chicken is from South-East Asia. This is the area east
              of India and south of China.

            <h3 class="title">Beef</h3>
            <div class="content">
              Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle (Bos taurus). In
              prehistoric times, humankind hunted aurochs and later domesticated
              them. Since that time, numerous breeds of cattle have been bred
              specifically for the quality or quantity of their meat. Today,
              beef is the third most widely consumed meat in the world, after
              pork and poultry. As of 2018, the United States, Brazil, and China
              were the largest producers of beef. Beef can be prepared in
              various ways; cuts are often used for steak, which can be cooked
              to varying degrees of doneness, while trimmings are often ground
              or minced, as found in most hamburgers. Beef contains protein,
              iron, and vitamin B12. Along with other kinds of red meat, high
              consumption is associated with an increased risk of colorectal
              cancer and coronary heart disease, especially when processed. Beef
              has a high environmental impact, being a primary driver of
              deforestation with the highest greenhouse gas emissions of any
              agricultural product.

            <div class="content">
              Sushi (すし, 寿司, 鮨, 鮓, pronounced [sɯɕiꜜ] or [sɯꜜɕi]) is a
              Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice (鮨飯, sushi-meshi),
              usually with some sugar and salt, accompanied by a variety of
              ingredients (ねた, neta), such as seafood, often raw, and
              vegetables. Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, but
              the one key ingredient is "sushi rice", also referred to as shari
              (しゃり), or sumeshi (酢飯).[1] The inventor of modern sushi is
              believed to be Hanaya Yohei, who invented nigiri-zushi, a type of
              sushi most known today, in which seafood is placed on hand-pressed
              vinegared rice, around 1824 in the Edo period (1603–1867). It was
              the fast food of the chōnin class in the Edo period.[2][3][4]
              Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though
              it can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice. It is very
              often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail,
              salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are
              vegetarian. It is often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi,
              and soy sauce. Daikon radish or pickled daikon (takuan) are
              popular garnishes for the dish. Sushi is sometimes confused with
              sashimi, a related dish in Japanese cuisine that consists of
              thinly sliced raw fish or occasionally meat.[5]
